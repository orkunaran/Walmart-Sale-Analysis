In this recruiting competition, job-seekers are provided with historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions. Each store contains many departments, and participants must project the sales for each department in each store. To add to the challenge, selected holiday markdown events are included in the dataset. These markdowns are known to affect sales, but it is challenging to predict which departments are affected and the extent of the impact.

Want to work in a great environment with some of the world's largest data sets? This is a chance to display your modeling mettle to the Walmart hiring teams.

  

In this notebook we analyzed 45 different Walmart Store. The notebook included detailed Data cleaning, EDA, Machine Learning model comparison and hyperparameter tuning of the best model. 
  
  In the light of our approaches to the dataset, Random Forest Regressor resulted the best prediction of 2012 sales. And hyperparameter tuning decreased the Weighted mean Squared Error score slighltly which we accepted it as insignificant.
